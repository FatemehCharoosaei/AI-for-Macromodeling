# CWLSTM
CWLSTM for Modeling nonlinear Circuites
1-Generating Data for nonlinear circuites like High-speed input buffer by LTSPICE or ngspice software that the data is in : (High-speed input buffer.rar)
2- Implementation (cwrnn.py) & (__init__.py) for CWLSTM that they are into the (Libraries.rar).
3- Preparing, Preprocessing and Scaling the data between (0-1) to pass to network and use the (cwrnn.py) & (__init__.py) by call them in the CWLSTM.ipynb file.
4- Add the LSTM to layers into the ClockworkRNN when we define the layers of the model.
5- Comparing the results between Shallow RNN and CWLSTM and plot the results of them in the (CWLSTM.ipynb) file.

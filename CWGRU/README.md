# CWGRU
CWGRU for modeling behaviour of nonlinear Circuites
1-Generating Data for nonlinear circuites like Five Coupled T-line by LTSPICE or ngspice software that the data is in : (Five Coupled T-line.rar)
2- Implementation (cwrnn.py) & (__init__.py) for CWGRU that they are into the (Libraries.rar).
3- Preparing, Preprocessing and Scaling the data between (0-1) to pass to network and use the (cwrnn.py) & (__init__.py) by call them in the CWGRU.ipynb file.
4- Add the GRU to layers into the ClockworkRNN when we define the layers of the model.
5- Comparing the results between Deep RNN and CWGRU and plot the results of them in the (CWGRU.ipynb) file.

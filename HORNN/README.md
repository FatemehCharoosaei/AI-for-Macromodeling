# HORNN
High-Order Deep Recurrent Neural Network With Hybrid Layers for Modeling Dynamic Behaviour of Nonlinear High-Frequency Circuites
1- Generating Data from nonlinear circuites like schmitt trigger or 18_5 by LTSPICE or ngspice software which the name of the Data is: (18_5.rar) and we should download and unrar it.
2- Implementation (high_order_rnn_cell.py) and (utils.py) for High Order RNN in (code.rar) that we should download and unrar it.
3- Preparing, Preprocessing, and scaling the data between (0-1) to pass to network and use the (high_order_rnn_cell.py) and (utils.py) by call them in the (HORNN.ipynb).
4- Comparing the results between shallow RNN, Deep RNN, Deep LSTM, HORNN (Order 2, 3) and Hybrid-HORNN by combining the Orders (for example Order 1, 3)
